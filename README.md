# CATIgorise üóÑÔ∏è

A tool used to categorise CATI verbatim responses into a set list of categories.
Inputted data should be in `csv` format, and outputted data retains all input data into a new file with the `category` column edited. 

## Usage

CATIgorise currently is based on the action of installing a new gas meter, but that is easily edited in the source code if needed.
To add another category, add it to the `prompt` in `main.py`.
You will also need your own API key from OpenAI, and a new file called `env.py` with the following line:
```python
APIKEY = "YOUR_KEY_HERE" # replace with your own generated key
```

## Dependencies
Only the OpenAI library is needed, install with the following commands.

#### MacOS:
```shell
pip3 install openai
```

#### Windows:
```shell
pip install openai
```
